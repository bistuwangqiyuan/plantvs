# Specification Quality Checklist: 竖屏网页版植物大战僵尸游戏

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Details**:
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- 5 detailed user stories with clear priorities (P1-P3) and independent test descriptions
- 47 functional requirements covering all aspects of gameplay, UI, performance, and data persistence
- 15 success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Clear assumptions and dependencies documented
- Out of scope items explicitly listed
- Detailed executable development plan with 10 phases and time estimates

**Note**: Specification includes a detailed development plan in the spec itself. While this is implementation-related, it was specifically requested by the user and serves as a guide for execution rather than leaking implementation details into the core requirements.

## Notes

✅ Specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`)

All checklist items have been validated and pass inspection. The specification is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for development planning.
